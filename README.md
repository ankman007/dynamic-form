## Project Description

The main idea of this project is to create a React component that can generate various forms based on a JSON schema. The form can dynamically create fields like text input, checkboxes, etc., according to the schema provided. 

By using this approach, we avoid the need to manually make specific forms for various scenarios. Instead, we can create a dynamic form generator that seamlessly adapts to any schema it receives.

This project utilizes React to craft reusable user components and Material UI for design & styling.
